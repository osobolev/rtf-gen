/**
 * Interface for a text element.
 * <p>
 * Remark: I looked at the interface javax.swing.text.Element, but I decided to
 * write my own text-classes for two reasons:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>The javax.swing.text-classes may be very generic, I think they are
 * overkill: they are to heavy for what they have to do.
 * <LI>A lot of people using iText (formerly known as rugPdf), still use
 * JDK1.1.x. I try to keep the Java2 requirements limited to the Collection
 * classes (I think they're really great). However, if I use the
 * javax.swing.text classes, it will become very difficult to downgrade rugPdf.
 * </OL>
